# REVELation

**Snapshot Presenter Framework**

A modular system for building, styling, and presenting 
Markdown-based [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slide 
decks. Easily theme, enhance, and share beautiful 
presentations — ideal for speakers, teachers, and content 
creators.

---

REVELation Snapshot Presenter is the easiest way to create 
and deliver elegant, media-rich presentations using Reveal.js 
— no web dev skills required. It gets you up and running out 
of the box with zero config, extended Markdown support, and a 
simple file-based system. Whether you're a teacher, speaker, or 
content creator, REVELation helps you focus on your message — 
not your markup — with features like background videos, reusable 
macros, and one-command presentation scaffolding. Use it 
directly (to incorporate into your web development project)
or download our companion [GUI app](https://github.com/fiforms/revelation-electron-wrapper)
for a seamless authoring experience.

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. Install and Launch

Clone and install the framework:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fiforms/revelation.git
cd revelation
npm install
```

---

Start the local server:

```bash
npm run dev         # localhost only
# OR
npm run serve       # LAN-ready with remote control features
```

The link to access your presentation hub will show on the terminal.

### 2. Create a Presentation

```bash
npm run make
```

This will scaffold a new presentation folder under `presentations_<key>/`.

Edit the `presentation.md` file in your new folder to start creating content.
